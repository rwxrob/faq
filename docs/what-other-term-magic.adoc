= Where's more terminal magic?

This book just scratches the surface of what is possible using a terminalâ€”especially bash on a full Unix-like system. Several terminal tools have been left out of this book that are critical but covered in another book: https://rwxrob.github.io/books/terminal-velocity[_Terminal Velocity, Mastering the fastest human-computer interface_]. These include:

- `tmux` - terminal multiplexer and so much more
- `w3m` - terminal web-browser 10x faster than GUI browsing
- `mods` - Claude AI integration and query from CLI
- `find` - most powerful Unix command for finding and transforming files
- `podman` - run containers from the command line
- `gh` - even more that can be done with the `gh` tool
- `git` - more powerful git functionality
- `nvim` - the power of treesitter and other plugins

_Terminal Velocity_ also covers advanced bash scripting and creating a "dot files" repo using a https://github.com/rwxrob/bonzai[Bonzai] monolith.
