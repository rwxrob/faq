= Why GitHub?
The case for the most widely used development platform

When it comes to platforms for managing and collaborating on code, there are several contenders, including GitLab, SourceHut, and Bitbucket. However, GitHub remains the most widely used and influential platform for developers worldwide. Here’s why GitHub consistently outshines its competitors, even for those who might have reservations about its corporate backing by Microsoft.

== The power of popularity

GitHub’s dominance in the market isn’t just a matter of numbers—it’s a testament to its value:

**Largest Developer Community**: With millions of active users and repositories, GitHub is the go-to platform for collaboration and discovery. The sheer size of its community means more opportunities for networking, learning, and contributing to meaningful projects.

**Industry Standard**: Most companies, open-source projects, and educational platforms use GitHub as their primary development hub. Knowledge of GitHub is often expected in job applications, making it a must-know platform for developers.

== Superior visibility

**Searchability**: GitHub's advanced search tools make it easy to find projects, issues, and contributions, helping you discover opportunities and solutions faster.

**Project Showcase**: A GitHub profile serves as a portfolio, showcasing your work to potential employers, collaborators, and contributors. Public repositories on GitHub are more likely to be discovered and gain traction compared to other platforms.

**Integration with Ecosystems**: GitHub integrates seamlessly with countless third-party tools and services, from CI/CD pipelines to deployment platforms.

== Best-in-class command-line tool

GitHub’s command-line tool, `gh`, offers unparalleled efficiency for developers who prefer working in the terminal:

**Ease of Use**: `gh` simplifies common tasks like creating issues, managing pull requests, and cloning repositories—all without leaving the command line.

**Efficiency in Workflow**: GitHub’s CLI provides shortcuts for managing projects and repositories directly, saving time and effort.

**Advanced Features**: Interactive features like viewing pull request details or switching between branches are intuitive and developer-focused.

== Comparing to GitLab, SourceHut, and others

**GitLab**: While GitLab offers powerful CI/CD features, its interface and community size don’t match GitHub’s. GitLab’s paid tiers are often necessary for features GitHub offers for free, like private repositories.

**SourceHut**: SourceHut appeals to minimalists but lacks the extensive features, integrations, and user base that GitHub provides.

**Bitbucket**: Popular for enterprise solutions, Bitbucket trails GitHub in open-source adoption and community engagement.

== Addressing Microsoft ownership

For some, Microsoft’s acquisition of GitHub in 2018 raised concerns. Many don't know that Microsoft saved GitHub from catastrophic bankruptcy. However, Microsoft has largely honored its commitment to maintaining GitHub’s independence and focus on supporting open-source development.

**Investment in Features**: Since the acquisition, GitHub has introduced numerous improvements, including GitHub Actions, Codespaces, and enhanced security features.

**Open-Source Support**: GitHub remains home to the world’s largest collection of open-source projects, demonstrating its dedication to fostering community-driven development.

== Conclusion

While alternatives like GitLab and SourceHut have their merits, GitHub’s unparalleled visibility, expansive community, and best-in-class tools make it the platform of choice for developers worldwide. Even for those wary of Microsoft’s involvement, GitHub’s contributions to open-source development and its continued innovation make it an essential part of any developer’s toolkit. Choosing GitHub means joining the largest, most active network of developers and setting yourself up for success in the modern software development ecosystem.
