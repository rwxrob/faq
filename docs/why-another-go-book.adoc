= Why another Go book?

I've spend several hundred dollars on Go books, always wanting to find one I could just use and recommend to absolute beginners—who have not only never coded before—but didn't know the word "code" could be used as a verb, the type of beginner who thinks "print" involves a printing press or things that run out of toner, those who have never heard the words "Linux" or "GitHub" before in their lives, who think a "terminal" is something to run through at the airport when they are late for a flight. "Go, do you mean like Okay Go, that band from 90s?" These wonderfully clueless people have absolutely zero tech background and never regretted it, until now. Now, for whatever reason, they want to learn to code and, you guessed it, they cannot find a single book out there written for _them_.

I've been a nerd and a geek my entire life and have the photos to prove it (look up the difference). It turns out, I also have a gift for linguistics that includes speaking fluent Russian, French, Creole and English but also translating techno-babble into comprehensive prose and conversation in order to help _anyone_ to discover how to learn _anything_ in their own way. Since starting SKILSTAK Coding Arts in 2013 and learning and teaching Go in 2014 (when TJ Hallowaychuk famously wrote https://medium.com/@tjholowaychuk/farewell-node-js-4ba9e7f3e52b[Farewell to Node]) I have noticed all Go books suffer from one or more of the following annoyances:

- Incorrect or out of date material
- Avoid real, practical applications
- Shun the terminal, except to compile
- Assume "some programming" already, usually C
- Lack a free and supportive learning community
- Take themselves too seriously to be memorable or fun
- Ignore how to setup a personal development environment
- Pick poor project ideas that are too big and easily forgotten

Most of these books have some sort of dependency on the Internet to get the accompanying code, but none have any kind of downloadable personal learning assistant app, like the one I developed in Go for this book: Code-Mage.

At the risk of sounding too negative, I'll describe the straw that broke my back. I bought a $40 book to learn about generics that turned out to not cover generics at all—but even worse—contained an entire chapter _claiming_ to teach generics that contained a vague proposition for generics that was never adopted by the language. This author and publisher rushed their book out based on false information confusing me and potentially thousands of others. Then they charged another $40 for a "new edition" of the same book without even attempting to give anyone back the money they wasted for the first book. I lost hundreds in premium time wasted. You can probably guess the book, author, and publisher, which is notorious for this kind of fraudulent cash-grab.

Needless to say, I was furious. Most books are written by great people who have put a lot of time and energy into them. At worse they are annoying in their imperfections. But this blatant "screw you, give us your money" made me mad enough to follow my own mantra: _don't get mad, get busy_. I started thinking about what I would put into a book based on what I _knew_ hundreds of absolutely non-technical people I had helped to learn Go as a first language would want, and now you are reading it.
