= Why bash for beginners?

When learning to use the command line, choosing the right shell is crucial. While there are many shells available, such as Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell, **bash** (Bourne Again Shell) stands out as the best option for beginners. Here’s why:

== Ubiquity and universality

**Default shell on most systems**: Bash is official shell of the Linux project and the default shell on the majority of Linux distributions. Zsh is only the default on macOS because Apple refuses to accept the terms of the license change on the bash project (even though they say it is because zsh is "superior"). Bash is widely available, making it the most accessible shell for learners across different platforms.

**Cross-platform compatibility**: Bash works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via Git Bash or WSL), ensuring consistent usage regardless of your operating system.

**Industry standard**: Bash scripts are used in countless production environments, making knowledge of Bash a valuable skill in the job market. Modern bash is far more secure than the ancient POSIX shell scripts from the boomer UNIX era (use of `[[ ]]` that does not allow expansion injection attacks is just one example).

== Simplicity and beginner-friendliness

**Straightforward syntax**: Shell scripting is never really _that_ easy, its just powerful. But bash’s syntax is relatively simple and easy to grasp for newcomers—especially when compared to monstrosities like PowerShell. Commands and scripting follow logical, minimalistic patterns that are less intimidating for beginners. In fact, every line a person types on the command-line is an ongoing, running, interactive program. Placing any of those same commands into a file and running it becomes a script. In that sense, using bash at all _is_ itself "coding."

**Rich documentation**: Bash has an abundance of resources, including tutorials, man pages, and community support. Most command-line learning materials are written with Bash in mind, making it easier to find help.

**No Overwhelming Features**: Unlike Zsh or Fish, which come with extra features and plugins that can confuse new users, Bash focuses on core functionality, allowing learners to build a strong foundation. Most importantly, bash generally only uses a single `~/.bashrc` file rather than splitting them all out making it easy to configure and even easier to share that same configuration on any other system by simply copying a single file (which is what `cm init` does).

== Portability and practicality

**Write once, run Anywhere**: Bash scripts are portable and can be executed on almost any Unix-like system without modification—especially if the convenient (albeit slightly less safe and performant) `#!/usr/bin/env bash` idiom is used (which is essentially required to get bash scripts to work on Homebrew macOS machines that put the latest bash binary in a strange place by default).

**Widely Used in Scripting**: Bash is the default scripting language for many tasks, such as automating workflows and managing servers. Learning Bash provides immediate practical applications in automation and system administration.

**Learning Core Unix Tools**: By using Bash, beginners gain experience with essential Unix tools (e.g., `ls`, `find`, `grep`), which are foundational for more advanced shell scripting and programming.

== Zsh and other shells: why not start there?

**Zsh**: Zsh offers many advanced features (e.g., plugins, themes, and auto-suggestions) that are appealing for experienced users. However, these extras can distract beginners from mastering core shell concepts. And no one ever writes a "zsh script" for anything because no one can count on zsh being on the system and writing POSIX shell scripts is less secure and more annoying.

**Fish**: Fish is user-friendly and visually appealing but is not POSIX-compliant, meaning scripts written in Fish are not portable across systems. It introduces unique syntax that can make transitioning to other shells or environments more difficult. More importantly, however, fish promotes terminal muscle memory that does not work when on another system without it, a common occurrence in todays cloud-native, containerized, virtualised world.

**PowerShell**: PowerShell is powerful and Windows-centric but diverges significantly from Unix-style shells, making it less relevant for those learning Linux or macOS environments.

== Conclusion

For beginners, **Bash is the ideal starting point**. Its simplicity, availability, and practicality make it the best choice for learning the command line. By mastering Bash first, you’ll build a strong foundation in shell usage and scripting that will serve you well in any technical career.
