= What is the best tool for the job?

Almost every serious question wanting my opinion on something could have been rephrased into the question: What is the best tool for the jobâ€”right now? I've had to add that "right now" part because this list changes from year to year, sometimes even month to month. In tech the only thing constant is that nothing is constant.

It might help to know my preferences:

- Most likely to be required working for a large corporation
- Used and recommended by _actual_ professionals (not "influencers")
- Popular because of successful, wide-adoption
- Mature, stable, and easy to use
- As open sourced as is practical (_never_ GPLv3)
