= I use Linux, btw—for three decades

Me: "I wish I could get a Sun box at home."

Joey: "You could always use Linux."

It 1994 my Unix mentor from Teleport suggested I learn more about Linux. I got a Pentium II at work to run it even though only the terminal worked. I installed MkLinux on my PowerPC from Apple in 1994. I didn't care if I would never get my Apple operating system back nor play Need for Speed with my cool Thrustmaster wheel ever again. I was permanently forced to use the terminal for _everything_ including email over PPP dialup. I've been using Linux almost every day since.

== Garage full o' Linux

Within a two years I had a garage full of old computers given new life as Linux servers. I had to clean them and burn CDs with Linux OS on them. It took forever to set them up. In the process I was so anxious I put my servers online in a rush after I got my first domain (tuxzone.net). I got hacked immediately because I forgot to run the hardening software of the day. I was in too much of a hurry to give out free access to Linux so others could learn about it like Joey had done for me. I did manage to catch that hacker right away, however, by setting up Tripwire.

== Most powerful workstation

At work (Teleport Internet Services) I was given the most powerful workstation of anyone in the company (that wasn't a Sun box) a Pentium II. Despite all the power it would not run any of the graphic Linux desktops. The best admins in the building, who creating an ISP couldn't get it to work. It had the power, but—as is still the case—Linux desktop environments are just quirky and unstable, then and now.

== Linux desktop sucks

People hate me for telling them the truth about Linux desktop. It's horrible—even today—compared to the experience of a Macbook Pro or, yes, even a Windows machine. I've got more years of experience using all Linux DT environments than many people have been alive—including the most recent stuff.

Use the right tool for the job, and the right tool for the desktop is just not Linux and never has been. Perhaps someday, but I've heard people say that for nearly 30 years and it still hasn't happened. Linux server is where it's at, not the desktop.

== Linux saved my job

My Linux lab saved my job during the crash of 2000. I took a SysAdmin job because of the skills I had learned managing Linux in my garage.

== Among first Linux livestreamers

My first livestreams were from a Linux machine. Not many people could say they were streaming from Linux desktop in 2021. I was constantly fighting with one thing or another. Ultimately, I gave it up. The main reason: I value my time. Here's why:

- Want Streamlabs? Forget it.
- Want StreamAvatars? Nope.
- Want to stream Zwift? Forget about it.
- SolidWorks for some 3D modeling? Can't.
- Prefer _real_ professional creative tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premier? Don't make me laugh.
- Gaming from Linux? Seriously? Okay, if you want slow games for no reason.
- What's that screen-ripping? Get used to it. You will fix and driver update will break it again.

[NOTE]
====
People that claim everything "works for them" are lying. They just hide it. When you politely press them for details and get to know them, the truth comes out. I've heard Linux liars since 1996. I don't get it. It's okay to say when something is bad. It doesn't mean you don't support it. The truth is Linux never has and never will be amazing for livestreaming and gaming, not for 99.9% of people, the ones who value their time to do other things.
